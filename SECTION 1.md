# ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES

## INFORMATION GATHERING

### Passive recognition

Manual website recon and foot printing
=========================================

Collect all data possible: IP addresses, name, phones, other type of information...

1. **IP address**:

   Sometimes webs have proxy or firewall like cloudfare. If website it is behind a proxy we could have two or more Ips. We can perform a "traceroute" or a "ping" to each IP address to determine which one shows a more direct route to the web server. The IP address with the shortest route and the fewest hops is usually the real web server's IP.

    ```
    host <website>
    ```

4. **Look for files**:

    - /robots.txt: list of directories that are not indexed by search engines
  
    - /sitemap.xml, /sitemaps.xml: authors, categories, list of all the pages on a website that the website owner wants search engines to index

5. **Plugins**
    
    - Wappalyzer

    ```
    builtWith
    ```

6. **Terminal commands**:

    ```
    whatweb
    ```

7. **Source code web**:

    To analyze source code and structure of website:
    
    ```
    webhttrack
    ```

Whois enumeration
=================

Internet protocol for querying databases, domain names, ip address block, ...Â 

To obtain nameserver, actual owner, other personal data, ... we can use:

```
whois
```

Netcraft
========

Domain information, web technologies, user data... all information that previously we obtained manually. SSL, TFL vulnerabilities, trackers on the web

DNS Recon
=========

Process of gathering information about a domain. It includes the following methodologies:

- **Discovering DNS Servers**: Identifying the DNS servers responsible for resolving domain names for a target network.

- **Enumeration**: Enumerating DNS records to gather information such as subdomains, mail servers, and other DNS resource records (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) that can be useful for mapping the target's network and potential attack vectors.

**DNS records**

Are essential components of the DNS infrastructure that provide information.  Each DNS record type serves a specific purpose and contains different types of information. Here are some common DNS record types:

- MX: mail register

- NS: name server register
  
- A: subdomain IP address register

More dns information with:
  
- Dnsdumpster: hosts graphs. <https://dnsdumpster.com/>

```
dnsrecon -d <domain name>
```

WAF
===

A fingerprinting tool that analyzes WAF solutions, identifies if web is protected by firewall or WAF and which WAF is using. 

**Notes:**

- Using -a for testing all waf instances.

```
wafw00f
```

Subdomain enumeration
=====================

**Notes:**

- Using -e to specify search engines.
- The command sublist3r has the option of doing bruteforce attacks or passive recognition.

```
sublist3r
```

Google dorks
============

- site:

- site:*.

- inurl:admin

- intitle:admin

- intitle:index off

- cache: last versions

- waybackmachine: screenshots of website in the past

- inurl:auth_user_file.txt

- inurl:passwd.txt

- Google Hacking Database

Email harvesting
================

When looking for exposed mail address, hosts and IPs. 

**Notes:**
- Using -b for certain search engine.

```
theHarvester
```

Leaked passwords databases
==========================

When emails are found we can check if credentials have been leaked with:

### Active recognition

DNS Zone Transfers
==================

To resolve domains name or hostnames to IP addresses:

- <https://zonetransfer.me>

**DNS records:**

- A: domain to ipv4

- AAAA: domain to ipv6

- NS: name server

- MX: mail server

- CName: alias

- TXT: text record

- SOA: domain authority

- SRV: service

- PTR: ip to hostname

**Dns interrogation** is the process of enumerating dns records.

**Zone transfer**: transfer dns record to another one if misconfigured an attacker can copy the primary dns zone files to another one. 

**Zones files**: contains records for a particulary domain.

For zone transfer, bruteforce, ...

`dnsenum`

When looking for hostnames, ips addresses, domain names in a dns server:

`sudo vim /etc/host `

Another dns look up utility:

`dig `

For zone transfer attack

```
dig axfr @<domain>

fierce -dns
```

Host discovery with Nmap
========================

After indetifying my IP use nmap for host discovery.

**Notes:**

- Use -sn option with nmap to avoid port scan and only look for hosts

```
nmap -sn <url>

sudo netdiscover
```

Port Scanning with nmap
=======================

The following options are the most common ones:

- -sn: no port scan

- -Pn: for windows host so they don't block ping request

- -p- : tcp port range

- -p<port,port>: specify port or ports

- -F: fast scan with 100 top ports

- -sU: udp port scanning

- -v: display info on whats happening on the background

- -sV: service detection

- -O: operating system detection

- -sC: scripts on the open ports to identify more information

- -A: scripts, servide detectation and operating system

- T0-T5: slower-faster, higher more noise

- -oN <file>: output

- -oX <file>: for metasploit
